### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### General Questions

1. **How does my theme change according to the wallpaper?**
   - I use a tool called pywal, which automatically extracts colors from the wallpaper and applies them to the theme.

2. **How do I add an audio visualizer to the bar?**
   - I utilize a script from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/username/repo) (you will need mpd).

3. **What's the name of the music playing?**
   - The current track is "Take Off" by Chris Heria. You can find it on Spotify (download using SpotiFlyer).
