## How to achieve blur - **GNOME ONLY**

- To achieve true liquid glass finish, you need some amount of blur for the launcher.
- But GTK doesn't support any blur filter through CSS.
- Install [Blur My Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/)
- Apply the settings as follows:
